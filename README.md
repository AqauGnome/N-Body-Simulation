# N-Body-Simulation
a simple unoptimized simulation of an n body system using Newtonian gravity

so far there are many problems:

- the velocity is exponentially increased far too fast, and seems to not even be directed towards other particles
- the velocity is printed in the terminal so you can xamine the numbers
